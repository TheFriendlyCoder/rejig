**Rejigger** templates are simply folders which contain a [YAML](https://yaml.org) formatted manifest file describing the template and its various options, along with any other files and folders which define the content of the project it creates. The sections below describe how to define a template and how the application manipulates the template to generate new projects from it.
sure to select the "golang" language preferences in the tool to ensure you are using a validator that is compatible with **Rejigger**.
